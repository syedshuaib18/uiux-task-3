## 🎯 Objective

Redesign Instagram’s user interface to address a key **pain point**:  
🔍 *Cluttered interface and poor discoverability of features.*

## 🧠 Pain Points Identified

- Overcrowded header with multiple icons.
- Stories section takes up too much space.
- Post actions are not visually balanced.
- Reels, Explore, and Saved features are hard to discover.
- Visual fatigue due to poor spacing and contrast.

## ✅ Redesign Goals

- ✨ Simplify the top bar: Only logo + search icon.
- 🌀 Compact Stories: Smaller profile rings with horizontal scroll.
- 📸 Larger media: More focus on the content, less on UI clutter.
- 🧭 Clear navigation: Redesigned bottom bar with minimalist icons (Home, Search, Create, Reels, Profile).
- 🔤 Better typography: Higher contrast and readability.
- 🎨 Clean color palette: White background, soft shadows, and minimal distractions.
